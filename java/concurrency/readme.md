## Threads

### States

      New -> Runnable    <-->    Running -> Dead
                  <- Waiting/Blocking->
            
### Code-Samples

1. Puzzler_03_a.java:
If you don't get other answers than 'We have an answer = 42'
    - run in java server VM (instead of client VM)
    - play around with optimization switches (see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html#BGBCIEFC)
    - repeat, repeat ...

2. deadlocks
Idea behind the Philosoper(s)-solution: Lock resources in a guaranteed order
